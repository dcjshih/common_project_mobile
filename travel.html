            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting

            <h3>Geographical Location: Asia</h3>
            <p>The Great Wall was continuously built from the 3rd century BC to the 17th century AD on the northern border of the country as the great military defence project of successive Chinese Empires, with a total length of more than 20,000 kilometers.
                The Great Wall begins in the east at Shanhaiguan in Hebei province and ends at Jiayuguan in Gansu province to the west. Its main body consists of walls, horse tracks, watch towers, and shelters on the wall, and includes fortresses and
                passes along the Wall.</p>
            <p>The Great Wall reflects collision and exchanges between agricultural civilizations and nomadic civilizations in ancient China. It provides significant physical evidence of the far-sighted political strategic thinking and mighty military and
                national defence forces of central empires in ancient China, and is an outstanding example of the superb military architecture, technology and art of ancient China. It embodies unparalleled significance as the national symbol for safeguarding
                the security of the country and its people.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: Asia</h3>
            <p>Located in the finest district Taipei has to offer, TAIPEI 101 is the largest engineering project ever in the history of the Taiwan construction business. Supported by a dozen or so domestic businesses, the TFC Corp. was fortunate to have
                local and international experts in charge of the planning, and world-class architect C.Y. Lee was responsible for the design of the project. The design transcends the unit-body concept and is based on the Chinese number 8, a numeral long
                considered lucky in Chinese culture. Eight-floor structural units are connected one by one on top of each other to form the whole. This kind of rhythmic aesthetic is new to skyscrapers.</p>
            <p>The sectional TAIPEI 101 employs a Mega Structure System for disaster and wind damage prevention. As every eight floor constitutes an autonomous space, wind effects on the surface seen in high-rise buildings are eliminated. The design of the
                foundation guarantees pedestrian safety and comfort. Resembling the flexible yet persistent bamboo that rises into the sky, the building is a reflection of traditional Chinese building philosophy. Inclining 7 degrees inwards, the structure
                increases in size as it gets higher. The transparent and non-reflective curtain walls are energy efficient and heat reflective, enabling those in Taiwan's tallest building to have a clear view of the world around them. High-tech materials
                and innovative illumination creates a see-through effect with transparency and clarity that facilitates the harmony between the building and its natural environment.</p>
