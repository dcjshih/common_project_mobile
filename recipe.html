            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it. Note, these cookies are best eaten very
                quickly.

            <p>Chinese dumplings are a classic comfort food and a favorite in our family. Making these dumplings from scratch is a bit of work, but the delicious result is well worth it. They're perfect for special occasions or when you simply crave some
                homemade goodness.
            </p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
                <li>2 cups finely chopped Napa cabbage</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 package round dumpling wrappers</li>
                <li>Water, for sealing dumplings</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine ground pork, chopped Napa cabbage, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and beaten egg. Mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Take a dumpling wrapper and place a spoonful of the pork mixture in the center. Dip your finger in water and moisten the edges of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half to create a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal. You
                    can also create pleats along the edge for a decorative touch.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add dumplings in a single layer, flat side down. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour 1/4 cup of water into the pan and immediately cover with a lid. Steam the dumplings for about 5-7 minutes or until the wrappers become translucent and the pork is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking until the water evaporates and the bottoms crisp up again.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce and vinegar.</li>
            </ol>
